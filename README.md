# binary-converter
Java learning project that takes an integer and converts it into binary.

This is the first project I've created (outside of tutorials). It was a mind bender, but very satisfying to see it work.

The order of the files to make sense of things is:

1. MainSequence3.java
2. DerBinaryCode.java
3. DerPattern.java
